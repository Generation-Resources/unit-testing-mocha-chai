# Unit Testing with Mocha + Chai

Generation: Unit Testing Debrief Assignment

## Directions

1. Install the needed dependencies, in your terminal run:

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

2. Run the test suite with the command

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

3. Navigate through the files and familiarize yourself with what's written. Try writing comments to explain what each line of code is doing to gain a better understanding of each expression.

4. Try experimenting with this code. There are always ways to simplify and make things less repetitive and more clear.
